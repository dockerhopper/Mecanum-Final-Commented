# Mecanum-Final-Commented
The final iteration and fully commented code for the Mecanum Code used for the 2023 FRC competition.
This should one of the first things that Mr. W... and Mr. Lan... will show the new coder that comes for the 2024 competition. 

If you want to start you need to pick a language, which should be java.
Then you need a few things, first is the coding environment, So here is a very quick guide to startup.
Please note that if you have your own laptap you are allowed to use that, it's much better that way FYI.


# <ins>Installation</ins>
PRE NOTE:   Do an offline installation since you won't have wifi at the arena. 

1:  uninstall everything on the computer, there is very limited space and we ran into issues early on with the space so this step is 
      mandatory if you're using the schools laptop.

2:  Go to [HERE](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/index.html) and just follow the steps there.
    Note, DO NOT USE LABVIEW

3:  Once you get to the FRC game tools, just follow the guide. Mr. W will have the account info that you have to input so that 
    You can actually use the tools there.
    
4:  One you get to this screen

It's important to do all the steps here. It's all required in order to code effeciantly.

# <ins>Coding Correctly</ins> 
Congrats, you just did a lot of work, good job. I know this can be daunting, don't worry, if I could do it, you definetely can to, I believe in you.
I should be at university right now when you are reading this but if you need help, don't hesitate to email me at the email Mr. W... will give to you.

I wanted to make sure that you have **tons** of resources availiable to you. Videos, examples, guides, CodeDelphi if you have questions, and many more.
So here are some of the resources I found exetremely helpful whilst coding the robot. 

 - [the WPILIBJ example projects](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/examples-tutorials/wpilib-examples.html)
 - [My favourite youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3-At2hTK9hVPv623YealxDAHim6FdJQ)
 - [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) , Yes, use chatgpt if you are really stuck, I didn't like using it for learning but it's super useful if you are 100% completely stuck and have exhausted all other options, I cannot emphasize the importance of learning rather than just getting the answers... If I find out you just used chatgpt the entire time I will be dissappointed
 - [This youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64hPDvphcfA&t=782s) and challing are fantastics, they are based in Alberta and are great friends of the team, explains the command based framework well even if it is a little dated.
    - If you notice that my code doesn't work anymore, or it says on vscode that the certain method has been deprecated, use [this](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/index.html). even use it in general, it has everysingle method required for the robot to run smoothely.

That should be it. Good luck out there fellow coder, I hope you get the same satisfaction I got when I saw the robot work for the first time.
OH and PS, make sure you call Mr. Walker old now and then, like "Your old." Or mention that he knows everything like, "Thanks Mr. Walker, that's why you know everything". It's so funny, even weave them together. 
You got this.
